Code assignment
We want to create an online tea shop, with the following features
A homepage that display the most expensive teas
A products page that display a list of teas with filters
A simple product page for each tea,
Shopping cart - No need for a checkout beyond the shopping cart

Technical features
You should use a database to persist the teas
Please use Angular on the front end and ruby on the backend, I want only JSON returning from the server,
no views.
The code should be built in a way that a new developer can take the repository and run with it.
I am giving you the freedom to interpret this in your own personal way
Use git

Please take design decision as if this project will be developed by
2 developers and will be maintained for the next 6 months.

No need for tests
